Essential to the Individual report is a critical assessment of your own role in
the project work. It is your opportunity to tell us what you did well in the
project, what you have learned, reflect on the project as a whole and on your
own role in the project.

The Individual report should detail your personal contribution to the work. It
is typically between 10 and 15 pages and contributes 40% of your project marks.
It is likely to contain the following:

\section{Introduction}
The aim of this report is the discussion of the Group Project that I took part
in as part of the NCS team, comprised of myself and Seng Jea Lee, Johann Mifsud,
Minin Zhang. In this report I will present my own role in the progress of
the project. The analysis will be broken into three main sections. In objectives
and achievements I will present the objectives we set through the duration of
the project as well as the achievements and my contribution to them. Moving to
the results of the project we will discuss the output of the project as well as
the quality of the outcome. In the third section, I will present my view on the
project management techniques and tools that we used along with my experience on
them. The interaction with the rest of the team members and the task
distribution will also be reported. In the final section I will present my own
contribution to the project.

\section{Objectives and Achievements}


    your own understanding of the project objectives and main achievements;

\section{Project Results}
    a critical assessment of the project results (e.g., how do you judge the
    quality of the final result, what were the important technical decisions
    this project, what worked well, what decisions you would change in the light
    of experience, etc.);

\section{Project Management}
    a critical assessment of the project management techniques used (e.g.,
    whether you followed standard software engineering processes, and if so then
    how well they worked or didn't work);

    a discussion and critical assessment of how well the team and each of its
    members worked from your point-of-view (e.g., whether decisions were
    adequately agreed, specified and documented, or had to be revised later,
    whether the work was appropriately split among team members);

    a description and critical assessment of your own workplan and contribution
    to the project (e.g., what aspects of the project did you contribute most
    to; whether you were over-worked or under-worked; whether you as an
    individual could have achieved more with different approaches and/or
    organisation).

In the Individual report, you may make reference to the submitted Group
documents for further detail, but the report should stand on its own.

Note that the Individual report is only made available to the Examiners and will
not be seen by any other students.
